## Overview
  This repository serves as the document for my 3 years long rigor self-study program designed to fill the gap between high school curicculum and advanced theoretical physics.
  Seeking a rigorous logic absent in standard curricula, I self-studied **Tom M. Apostol's *Calculus*** (Vol. 1) to master derivation from first principles. This mathematical foundation enabled me to progress through MIT OpenCourseWare syllabi for Multivariable Calculus, Linear Algebra, and Quantum Mechanics.

**Objective:** To Build the Mathematical foundation required to understand Quantum Field Theory 

## Curicculum Roadmap
The study was conducted in two distinct phases: **Mathematic** and **Quantum Mechanics**

| Phase | Subject | Source Material | Key Output |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **I** | **Rigorous Foundations** | *Calculus Vol. 1* (Apostol) | Derivation of Limits & Integrals |
| **I** | **Multi-Variable Calc** | MIT 18.02 (Denis Auroux) | Vector Fields, Flux, Stokes' Theorem |
| **I** | **Linear Algebra** | MIT 18.06 (Gilbert Strang) | Vector Spaces, Eigenvalues |
| **I** | **Differential Eq.** | MIT 18.03 (Arthur Mattuck) | Second-order ODEs, Fourier Series |
| **II** | **Quantum Physics I** | MIT 8.04 (Allan Adams) | Schrödinger Eq, 1-3D Potentials, Spin Theory |
| **II** | **Quantum Physics II** | MIT 8.05 (Barton Zwiebach) | Spin-1/2 Systems, Quantum Dynamics, N>2 States |
