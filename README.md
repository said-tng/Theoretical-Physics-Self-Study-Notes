## 📖 Overview
This repository serves as documentation for my 3-years long self-study program designed to build the foundation for studying quantum field theory.

Due to my seek for rigorous foundation, I self-studied **Tom M. Apostol's *Calculus*** (Vol. 1) to master derivation from first principles. This mathematical foundation enabled me to progress through MIT OpenCourseWare syllabi for Multivariable Calculus, Linear Algebra, and Quantum Mechanics.

**Objective:** To build the mathematical foundation required to understand Quantum Field Theory and engineer quantum simulations.
